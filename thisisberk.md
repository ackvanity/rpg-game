# This is Berk - Modules and Technical Documentation

This is Berk. We have quite a few people around, and I suppose some are eager
to introduce themselves. And don't walk away yet. This *is* necessary for your
work

Hi! I'm Tuffnut. I only have one job on the island: make sure everybody gets
inside when it's time to go home. Other than that, I just sit down while my
sister Ruff gets the hard part. She has to take notes on everything that
happens in the village!
