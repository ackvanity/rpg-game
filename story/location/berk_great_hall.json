    "name": "The Great Hall",
    "id": "berk_great_hall",
    "description": "Massive wooden beams stretch toward a smoky ceiling, their carvings telling generations of Viking victories and mistakes. The hall roars with laughter, clattering mugs, and the occasional dragon tail knocking over a chair. This is Berk's heart — where decisions are made, feasts are held, and the tribe's spirit burns brightest."
