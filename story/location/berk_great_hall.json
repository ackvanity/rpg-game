    "description": "Massive wooden beams stretch toward a smoky ceiling, their carvings telling generations of Viking victories and mistakes. The hall roars with laughter, clattering mugs, and the occasional dragon tail knocking over a chair. This is Berk's heart — where decisions are made, feasts are held, and the tribe's spirit burns brightest.",
    "ambient": [
        "A log crackles in the hearth, and voices rise and fall like waves in the storm outside. Someone starts a song, off-key but hearty, and a Nadder’s tail thumps against the wall in rhythm. The smell of roasted yak and mead fills the air, thick and familiar."
