    "description": "A hardy Viking island battered by storms and sea spray, perched at the far edge of the Barbaric Archipelago. Once plagued by dragon raids, Berk now thrives as a haven where humans and dragons live, train, and fight together. Wooden halls cling to the cliffs, smoke rises from the forge, and the air hums with wingbeats. This is the home of Hiccup and the Riders — a place of invention, courage, and endless stories. Whatever your journey holds, it begins here."
