    "description": "Perched high on the cliffs, this wooden tower leans into the endless wind. From here, the whole Archipelago spreads out like a map of mist and sea. Watchers take shifts spotting incoming ships, wild dragons, or storms. On clear nights, you can see the aurora dancing above the horizon."
